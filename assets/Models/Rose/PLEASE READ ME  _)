	I'm happy you found this file! The model was created entirely in blender. All colors for the render are blender materials. This has been a long project for me because it has been my introduction to 3D and blender. The goal of this project was to teach myself all about modeling and rendering. I wanted to finally release something  instead of building up works in progress. Every object has a mirror modifier not yet applied to keep everything modular. The eyes are incorrect for posing but that is a very simple fix. I have not rigged it but I might in the future. I want and appreciate feed back. I have accounts on lots of CG communities; just look up digitaldebonaire (I use it for everything). My email address is also digitaldebonaire@gmail.com . I am looking to get involved in some CG projects so don't be shy about asking. I hope you enjoy my model! Please share my work with other people.
	Later on,
